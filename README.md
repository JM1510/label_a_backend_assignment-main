The assignment
---------
A company specialised in car parts wants to modernise their company, and start selling their parts online. Being the pro car salesmen that they are, they decided to develop the front-end via another agency. They entrust the back-end to none other than Label A.

User stories were defined after some initial research:

* As a company, I want all my products in a database, so I can offer them via our new platform to customers
* As a client, I want to add a product to my shopping cart, so I can order it at a later stage
* As a client, I want to remove a product from my shopping cart, so I can tailor the order to what I actually need
* As a client, I want to order the current contents in my shopping cart, so I can receive the products I need to repair my car
* As a client, I want to select a delivery date and time, so I will be there to receive the order
* As a client, I want to see an overview of all the products, so I can choose which product I want
* As a client, I want to view the details of a product, so I can see if the product satisfies my needs

The following assumptions were made:

* We don't have to worry about the front-end, but should think of a data format a JavaScript application can handle
* We don't need to worry about the payment of the order. Who needs money anyway?
